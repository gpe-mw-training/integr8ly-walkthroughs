== Introduction

In this lab, you set up the environment for the labs in this course. You will install required software and download lab assets in the local environment. On OpenShift, a shared namespace {user-sanitized-username}-fuse is created and common services like AMQ Broker and PostgreSQL are deployed in this namespace. This namespace is used across the Fuse and Fuse Online labs for developing the usecases.

=== Goals

* Set up the developer tools on your desktop
* Authenticate the OpenShift client with the OpenShift Container Platform master API
* Install and use the OpenShift command line interface (CLI)

=== Prerequisites

* An open broadband Internet connection
* A terminal client, such as PuTTy for Microsoft Windows
* A current browser, such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
* OPENTLC credentials
* Enough disk space to install Red Hat CodeReady Studio, Red Hat Fuse, Red Hat AMQ and other programming tools (Maven, OpenShift CLI, Java).

[type=verificationFail]
Please follow the links on the right to download and install the required software tools before proceeding to next section.

=== Download Lab Assets to workstation

This course comes with a variety of lab assets that are version-controlled in GitHub. In this section, you clone or update the lab assets on your workstation so that they are available locally for use in the course labs.

. In a terminal shell, create a directory called `ai_advanced_labs` and change your working directory to it:
+
[source,sh]
----
$ mkdir ai_advanced_labs
$ cd ai_advanced_labs
----

. From this new directory, download the lab assets from GitHub and change your working directory to `agile_integration_advanced_labs/code`:
+
[source,sh]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/agile_integration_advanced_labs.git
$ cd agile_integration_advanced_labs/code
----
+
[NOTE]
This is the root folder for the lab assets. The absolute path to this folder is referred to as `$AI_EXERCISE_HOME` in the instructions.


=== Install Red Hat CodeReady Studio

. Using your browser, navigate to the product page for link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/[Red Hat CodeReady Studio].

. On the left side, click *Download*.
* Note that the latest release of Red Hat CodeReady Studio is highlighted near the top of the page.

image::images/dl_instructions.png[diagram, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]


Red Hat CodeReady Studio includes a variety of plug-ins for Eclipse. You use the following Red Hat CodeReady Studio plug-ins to complete the labs in the Red Hat OPEN middleware courses:

* *Integration Stack*: The Integration Stack suite of plug-ins is particularly important when using Red Hat(R) Fuse and Red Hat(R) AMQ. The Integration Stack is not included with Red Hat CodeReady Studio and must be manually installed.

* *EGit*: CodeReady Studio includes the Eclipse EGit plug-in, which provides Git project support. No additional installation is required. Git is an open source version control system, providing developers with fast, versatile access to their application code's entire revision history.

* *M2E*: Red Hat CodeReady Studio includes the Eclipse M2E plug-in, which provides support for Apache Maven projects. No additional installation is required. The M2E plug-in enables you to edit a Maven projectâ€™s `pom.xml` and run a Maven build from the IDE.

You can select the plug-in installation during the Red Hat CodeReady Studio installation process, or you can select these from the welcome page.

=== Install Red Hat Fuse 7.2.0 (Optional)

If you want to deploy and run the labs locally, you will need to install Red Hat Fuse on your laptop. Please download the Red Hat Fuse install from link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/fuse/download/[Red Hat Fuse Download] and follow the installation steps.

NOTE: Note that the skeleton code for the labs is provided as a Spring Boot application, so you can choose to test the labs locally using the spring-boot Maven plug-in, or from Red Hat CodeReady Studio. Optionally, you can install either standalone Red Hat Fuse Karaf or JBoss EAP depending on your preference, and deploy the labs to these standalone environments. As part of the labs, you will also be deploying the labs to an OpenShift Container Platform environment.


=== Install Red Hat AMQ 7.2.0

You need to run a Red Hat AMQ broker locally to execute some of the labs in this course. Please download the link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/amq/download/[Red Hat AMQ 7.2.0 Broker installer] and follow the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.2/html/using_amq_broker/installation[instructions] to install it on your laptop.

Once installed, please follow the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.2/html/using_amq_broker/getting_started[Getting Started] steps to start a new broker running locally on your laptop.

=== Deploy AMQ Broker on OpenShift Container Platform

We need to deploy AMQ 7 broker on OpenShift Container Platform. The general installation steps are documented here: link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.2/html-single/deploying_amq_broker_on_openshift_container_platform/[AMQ Installation of OpenShift Guide].

. Continue using the terminal where you logged into OpenShift using the `oc` command tool.
. Switch OpenShift project:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
oc project {user-sanitized-username}-fuse
----

. Create the service account `amq-service-account`:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
echo '{"kind": "ServiceAccount", "apiVersion": "v1", "metadata": {"name": "amq-service-account"}}' | oc create -f -
----

. Provide `view` role to `amq-service-account`:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:{user-sanitized-username}-fuse:amq-service-account
----

. Deploy the broker:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
oc new-app --namespace {user-sanitized-username}-fuse \
   --template=amq-broker-72-basic \
   -e AMQ_PROTOCOL=openwire,amqp,stomp,mqtt,hornetq \
   -e AMQ_USER=admin \
   -e AMQ_PASSWORD=password \
   -e AMQ_ROLE=admin
----

. Check that the broker pod is running.
. Make a note of the console URL by running the following command:

+
----
sh-4.2$
----

. Create the `sampledb` database:
+
----
createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres sampledb
----

. Log in to PostgreSQL:
+
----
PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD psql -h postgresql $POSTGRESQL_DATABASE $POSTGRESQL_USER

----

. You should see a database prompt as follows:
+
----
psql (9.6.10)
Type "help" for help.

sampledb=#

----

. Create the tables. Run the following commands on the PostgreSQL command line:
+
----
CREATE SCHEMA USECASE;
CREATE TABLE USECASE.T_ACCOUNT (
    id  SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    CLIENT_ID integer,
    SALES_CONTACT VARCHAR(30),
